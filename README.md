# <PreWork Study Guide Website>

## Description

The study guide was created for bootcamp students who were going through Prework. It contains useful notes on HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript. 
This guide will serve not only as a useful tool for practicing all the previously mentioned topics but will also be a one stop website with detailed information I have learned about each topic. 

This site will not only serve as a notes and revison tool but I can constantly update it as I learn more about each subject. That makes it a very helpful guide that shows my progression through my levels of understanding during the bootcamp
